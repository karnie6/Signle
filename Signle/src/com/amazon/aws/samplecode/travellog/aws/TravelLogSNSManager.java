/**
 * This is a utility class to manage SNS communication for entries and
 * comments.  It's largely responsible for taking the entities passed in
 * to the methods, breaking them down into SNS requests, and then
 * sending those requests to the SNS client.
 *
 * The SNS process involves three steps, all covered within this class:
 * <ol>
 * <li>Creating a new topic</li>
 * <li>Subscribing to a topic</li>
 * <li>Posting a new message to a topic</li>
 * </ol>
 *
 * We do not have support here for unsubscribing from a topic.  SNS
 * automatically handles the process of confirming a user's desire
 * to be subscribed.  Each message sent also includes an unsubscribe
 * link.  So this process can largely be dealt with automatically.
